Humaein Web Automation Agent
A Python-based web automation agent that can send emails through Gmail and Outlook based on natural language instructions. This project demonstrates how AI agents can interact with web interfaces to perform tasks autonomously.

Features
Natural Language Processing: Converts plain English instructions into structured email data

Multi-Service Support: Works with both Gmail and Outlook web interfaces

UI Analysis: Automatically analyzes web page structure to generate appropriate actions

Playwright Automation: Uses Microsoft Playwright for reliable browser automation

Mock LLM Integration: Includes placeholder for actual LLM API integration

Installation
Clone the repository

Install required dependencies including Playwright and browser components

Install additional Python packages for data handling and type support

Usage
Command Line Interface
Run the agent directly from the command line. The agent will prompt you for a natural language instruction and automatically handle the email composition and sending process.

Programmatic Usage
Import the WebAutomationAgent class and initialize it in your code. You can then send emails by providing natural language instructions programmatically.

API Integration (Conceptual)
The code includes a conceptual FastAPI endpoint structure for future web service integration, allowing the automation agent to be exposed as a web service.

How It Works
Instruction Parsing: The system parses natural language into structured email data including recipient, subject, body, and service selection

Browser Navigation: Automatically navigates to the appropriate email service website

UI Analysis: Analyzes the webpage structure to understand available interface elements

Action Generation: Creates a sequence of browser actions needed to compose and send the email

Execution: Performs the actions in the browser to complete the email sending task

Project Structure
The project is organized into several main components:

Email service enumeration defining supported platforms

Data classes for structured email information

LLM client for instruction parsing and UI analysis

Main automation controller handling the workflow

Conceptual API endpoints for future expansion

Current Limitations
Uses mock authentication instead of real OAuth integration

Employs basic pattern matching rather than actual LLM API calls

Relies on predefined UI selectors rather than dynamic generation

Features basic error handling without sophisticated recovery mechanisms

Future Enhancements
Integration with actual large language model APIs

Implementation of real authentication flows

Support for additional email providers beyond Gmail and Outlook

Enhanced UI analysis with computer vision capabilities

Comprehensive error recovery and retry logic

Proper FastAPI endpoints with authentication

Dependencies
Microsoft Playwright for browser automation

Python dataclasses for structured data containers

Python typing for type hints

Standard logging for execution monitoring

Important Notes
This is a demonstration project with mock functionality

Actual production use would require integration with real AI services

Browser automation may break if email service UIs change

Use responsibly and in compliance with email providers' terms of service
